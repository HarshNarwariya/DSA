# Solution

+ Start with each index as a center
+ Check if it's left and right are similar (expand from center)
+ Remember to do it with even length also.

### Example

"abaa"

##### Step 1
Take 'a' as center and find longest palindrome
:-) we get "a"

##### Step 2
Take 'b' as center and find longest palindrome
:-) we get "aba"

##### Step 3
Take 'a' as center and find longest palindrome
:-) we get "a"

##### Step 4
Take 'a' as center and find longest palindrome
:-) we get "a"


Therefore longest palindrome is "aba"
